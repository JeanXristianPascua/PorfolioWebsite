      <p>
        I'm a student at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology, studying Software Development. 
        I'm passionate about web development and I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. 
        I'm currently looking for a internship/job to gain experience and apply my skills in a professional environment. 
        I'm also open to freelance work and other opportunities. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or opportunities.
